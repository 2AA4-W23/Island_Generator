## How to run the product

_Command line args:

Generator:
-t: Generate Irregular Mesh
-p: Enter Number of Polygons to be made (Only if you have chosen Irregular Mesh)
-r: Choose amount of times to perform relaxation on mesh (Only if you have chosen Irregular Mesh)
-dim: Choose the dimensions of the grid (Only if you have chosen Grid Mesh)

Example uses:
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -t -p 25 -r 5    -> Generates an irregular mesh with 25 polygons, and performs 5 relaxations
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -dim 100  -> Generates a grid mesh with grid dimensions of 100x100

Visualizer:
-t: Choose if you are generating an Irregular Mesh
-d: Generate the mesh in debug mode

Example uses:
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg  -t   -> Use if you want to visualize an irregular mesh, without debug mode
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -d   -> Use if you want to visualize a grid mesh in debug mode

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one. 

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator 
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % 
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer 
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```
To viualize the SVG file:

  - Open it with a web browser
  - Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.
